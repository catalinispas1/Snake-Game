# Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Java Swing. The game features a snake that moves around the game area, eating apples to grow longer. The objective of the game is to control the snake and avoid colliding with the boundaries or its own body.

## Game Rules
Control the snake using the arrow keys or designated keys (customizable) to change its direction.
The snake moves continuously in the current direction until a new direction is given.
The snake grows longer by eating apples that randomly appear on the game area.
The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries or its own body.
The longer the snake gets, the more challenging it becomes to avoid collisions.

## Game Controls
Use the W A S D keys to control the snake's direction (make sure you don't have Caps Lock activated).
Press the designated key to start or restart the game after it ends.

## Getting Started
To run the Snake game, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
Clone or download the Snake Game repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.
Compile and run the GameFrame.java file to start the game.
The game window will appear, and you can start controlling the snake using the arrow keys or designated keys.

## Dependencies
The Snake game does not have any external dependencies. It is built using the standard Java libraries and Swing for the graphical user interface.

Enjoy playing the Snake game!
